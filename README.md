# Project Name: 
Hero Search

# Project Description:
On this activity I will be developing a basic site using scss, semantic html, javascript, and an API.
I will also build a basic search application using html, sass(scss), gulp, and javascript. 
The basic search application will connect to an API and populate the page with the results.

# Project Live Demo:
You can find a live version of this site [here](https://demetrius-b.github.io/Hero-Search/)

# Project Requirements:
## CSS/SCSS
- Variables for font family, font size, and an action color.
- One mixin for a useful, reusable segment of styles.
- Two uses of nesting, but never more than three levels deep.
- One placeholder (%) and at least three uses of extend.
- A folder structure consisting of at least 3 folders, 5 partial files, imported into a single main scss file.

## HTML
- Structure has a clear hierarchy of headings and parent-child relationships.
- Semantic elements are used appropriately to describe the content.
- Formatting and indention are consistent and aid in readability.

## Javascript
- External API is used effectively to achieve the content of the mockups.
- Query is captured from the search field for use in the XHR (AJAX call).
- Gulp is used to handle common development tasks (such as compiling scss to css).
- Data is written to the DOM from the API.

## Layout/Design
- Overall layout and structure adhere to or build upon the mockups provided.
- Colors used are appropriate to the subject matter.
- Layout matches the size and proportions of the mockups.

# Project Instructions:
Navigate to the search bar at the top middle of the page. Enter a comic book name in the search bar then click the search icon.
Your results will display below the search bar, you may click on the image to be redirected to the refernece page on the Marvel website.
